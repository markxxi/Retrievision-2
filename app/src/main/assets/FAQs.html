    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions  </h1>
    <p>Last updated November 08, 2024  </p>

<h3>What is Retrievision?</h3>
<p>Retrievision is a lost and found mobile application with automated image matching for STI College Calamba. The purpose of this application is to transfer most of the laborious lost and found process to the machine and leave only a few necessary actions to the users in order to promote efficiency and a streamlined process. Through such digitalization of lost and found, the tiresome work of manually searching around the campus, annoyance derived from the exhaustive writing of the descriptions of the lost items and their record keeping would be eliminated.</p>
<p>Retrievision then takes in these physical processes and related tools and assimilates them into one. Through the application, users can find a digital archive of the lost items they reported, be notified about the successful location of their lost belongings, and even be encouraged to participate in the volunteer work of finding and returning lost items due to an Integrity Board that promotes trust, competitiveness, and responsibility. By harnessing the competitive nature and the innate honesty of students and employees of the school, Retrievision aims to revolutionize the lost and found system for college life.</p>

<h3>Why is there a need for Retrievision?</h3>
<p>A persistent problem of human civilization is our ability to lose items quickly, made worse by our imperfect memory. Retracing our memories does not always yield great results, and most of the time we fail to remember key information. It is now up to others who find them or a lucky remembrance of key information that a person can find their lost item.</p>
<p>Naturally, this leads to frustrations and countless issues, and so we have come up with countless methods to fix this. The most common one used across the globe is the paper-based system. However, this traditional method suffers from certain problems, which also happened to plague STI College Calamba, problems that can be generalized into the following three:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transparency and Communication Issues: </strong>There is a lack of readily available and accessible reminders and materials for instructions, and an efficient method to proceed with the lost and found process creates a needlessly complex process of physically asking random employees about what to do to enact the lost and found process.</li>
    <li><strong>Confusing and Tiring Return Process: </strong>Owners face time-consuming processes when reclaiming lost belongings. Having no immediate material to remember the instructions of the lost and found process, who to ask for help, where to put the items, and the overall wasted time and effort makes the return process not worth it for many people.</li>
    <li><strong>Management Problems: </strong>Intermediaries are burdened with multiple responsibilities and encounter complications due to traditional paper-based records. The Intermediaries are tasked with several responsibilities, including recording lost and found incidents, safekeeping lost items, and acting as mediators in the retrieval process. Finders and Owners heavily depend on intermediaries, especially if face-to-face communication is not possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. What are the benefits of Retrievision?</h3>
<p>Effective time management is a critical yet often overlooked element in college life. Despite using various applications and calendars to improve efficiency, the fast pace and tight deadlines can lead to memory lapses and oversights. Misplacement of personal belongings exacerbates these challenges.</p>
<p>Amid these challenges, the wonders of Retrievision comes into action, a mobile application designed to streamline the lost and found reporting process. Retrievision provides features powered by machine learning models, and one of the major features promoted by the application is the automated image recognition tool. Such tools are applied to boost your experience and supply you with innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Retrievision offers the following key features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Effortless Reporting: </strong>Allows for quick reporting of lost or found objects through Computer Vision.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure Login: </strong>Ensures a fast and secure login and logout experience with Microsoft O365 Account.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital logbook: </strong>Ensures information is preserved.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time notification: </strong>Implements instant notifications when a match is found.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity page: </strong>Fosters a culture of trust and responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. What is a machine learning model?</h3>
<p>Machine learning is a program that had been trained to locate and identify patterns, and enact its own decisions through feeding it specific datasets such as a dataset of images. To better understand this, let us use the example of a dog. A dog can be trained to do tricks by showing it certain command symbols and rewarding its correct behavior. Through trial and error, the dog slowly learns to do tricks because it then recognizes the pattern of doing the action imposed by your command symbol and being rewarded for doing it. Now, returning back to machine learning, the same is true for it, as it is rewarded with positive feedback for properly identifying the patterns you intended, and slowly it gets better and better like a professionally trained dog.</p>

<h3>5. What is image recognition?</h3>
<p>Image recognition is a tool for a device to identify the contents of an image through Computer Vision. If machine learning can be likened to the brain of a dog, then image recognition are the sensory organs of the dog. Paired with machine learning models, the image recognition tool would be used to scan and analyze the contents of an image to provide the description the user desires. Using the analogy of the dog again, the dog can be told to fetch a stick and it will use its sensory organ to find the object, analyze, and confirm its identity as the stick.</p>

<h3>6. What are the contents of Retrievision and their use?</h3>

<h3>7. How would I know if my lost item has been found?</h3>
<p>You would receive a notification every time a user reports a lost item. But that is a general notification, and to precisely know if your lost item has been found, then you must proceed with using the scanning feature located at the yellow box at the center of the home page. Once, you have followed the procedures, you would be shown a list of potential matches which would allow you to check them for their details and know if they are your lost item or not.</p>

<h3>8. How long does a found and lost item report last?</h3>
<p>These reports last up to three months and would be cleared from user view and sent to archive after such length has passed. However, the length is not permanent and is subject to change.</p>

<h3>9. Where are the found items being stored?</h3>
<p>Found items are stored in the Students Affairs Department for safekeeping.</p>

<h3>10. How long does a found item stay in the Student Affairs Department?</h3>
<p>Just like the duration length of reports, found items are kept in the Student Affairs Department for three months. Again, the length is not permanent and is subject to change.</p>

<h3>11. What happens to found items after their storage length in the Student Affairs Department has passed?</h3>
<p>Found items that have not been claimed by anyone would be donated to charity every three months.</p>
